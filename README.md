# Why

#### React Vision is the result of Clinia's effort to make its expertise more accessible to its partners. The Vision tools allow partners to create their own health-care search experience, for internal or external use, using Clinia's search API.

# Features

- **[Widgets](./doc/widgets/README.md)** that offer bare UI components to be customized be the partners.
- **[Connectors](./doc/connectors/README.md)** that allows the partners to link their own components with the Clinia's search logic.
- Compatible with **React** and **React-Native**
- Available **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)** to experiment with the components

# Getting Started

React Vision is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) registry. It relies on [`cliniasearch`](https://github.com/clinia/cliniasearch-client-javascript) to communicate with Clinia APIs.

```
npm install react-vision-dom cliniasearch
```
OR
```
yarn add react-vision-dom cliniasearch
```

# Examples
## React example ([README](./examples/default))

Inside the **[React example](./examples/default)** folder:
```
yarn install
```
Then
```
yarn start
```

## React-Native example ([README](./examples/react-native))

Inside the **[React-Native example](./examples/react-native)** folder:
```
yarn install
```
Then
```
yarn start
```
This example uses **[Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo)** and can therefore be launch using the expo cli :
```
expo start
```
